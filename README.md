## Description
![Screenshot of taiwanese street](./media/sample.png)
Come one, come all! Come taste taiwanese style street food from my friend's homecooked goods. Taiwanese Street is the internet store front for Fried Snacks Diner, who sells fried skeweers, much like the ones that someone would find in a taiwanese street market. Taiwanese Street is complete with the ability to make a cart and checkout with Stripe.
